The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the `:focus-visible` pseudo-class. It's intended to style focused elements only when the focus is not triggered programmatically (e.g., by JavaScript). However, there's a subtle issue where certain browser extensions or assistive technologies might interfere with the expected behavior.

```css
.my-element:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid blue;
  box-shadow: 0 0 5px rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.5);
}
```

The problem is that the `:focus-visible` pseudo-class isn't universally supported across all browsers and assistive technologies in the same way.  Some might ignore it entirely, others might trigger it unexpectedly.

Inconsistent behavior across different browsers, extensions and assistive technology makes it difficult to reliably ensure styling only applies when user explicitly focuses elements with keyboard or mouse.
