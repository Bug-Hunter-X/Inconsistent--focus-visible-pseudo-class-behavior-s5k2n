# Inconsistent :focus-visible Pseudo-class Behavior in CSS

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue with the CSS `:focus-visible` pseudo-class.  The pseudo-class aims to style elements only when the focus is initiated by a user interaction (keyboard, mouse), not programmatically. However, its support and behavior vary across browsers, extensions, and assistive technologies.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.css` file offers a potential workaround, although it's not a perfect solution.

This issue highlights the challenges of creating consistently accessible and visually appealing focus styles across different user environments.
